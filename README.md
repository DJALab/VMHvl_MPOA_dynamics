# Dynamical systems analysis in VMHvl and MPOA

This is a repository of code for analyses of fit dynamical systems and to generate figures associated with the paper "An approximate line attractor in the hypothalamus that encodes an aggressive internal state" by Nair et al.

For questions about the code, please contact adi.nair AT caltech DOT edu.
For general questions about the paper, contact wuwei AT caltech DOT edu or ann.kennedy AT northwestern DOT edu

Code and notebooks for fitting models is available in the Linderman lab's repository at: https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm/blob/master/notebooks/4-Recurrent-SLDS.ipynb
